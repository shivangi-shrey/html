        <h2>Summary of movie</h2>
        <p>         The movie revolves around the life of seven friends who reunite after many years in times of crisis.

            'We all have our plans ready for the journey after being successful at something. But nobody ever talks about how to deal with failures,' says Ani (Sushant Singh Rajput) and breaks down. His teenaged son Raghav is battling between life and death in the hospital after a suicide attempt as he failed to crack the engineering entrance exam. Nitesh Tiwari's Chhichhore' borrows heavily from the real world. Ani (Sushant Singh Rajput)'s world comes crashing down after his son attempts to kill himself post failing to clear an exam. When the dejected kid gives up all hope to live, Ani sends a distress call to his closest buddies from his engineering days.
